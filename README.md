Hi there! My name is Allen, and I'm a Senior Computer Science student at UT Dallas in Texas. I have a strong background in AWS cloud computing, with four AWS certifications and two internships as a Cloud Support Engineer at AWS. In addition, I have experience in Machine Learning, Database Systems, Python, SQL and more!

I'm passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems, and I believe that open-source software plays a key role in making that possible. That's why I'm excited to be a part of the GitHub community.

Please don't hesitate to contact me for my email address: z1277436738@gmail.com.
